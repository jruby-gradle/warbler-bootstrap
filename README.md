# Warbler Bootstrap

[![Build Status](https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/job/jruby-gradle/job/warbler-bootstrap/badge/icon)](https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/job/jruby-gradle/job/warbler-bootstrap/) [![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/jruby-gradle/jruby-gradle-plugin.png)](https://gitter.im/jruby-gradle/jruby-gradle-plugin)

This project acts as a container for some of the `.jar` and `.war` bootstrap
code from the [jruby/warbler](https://github.com/jruby/warbler) project.

This is intended primarily to be used with the [jruby-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/jruby-gradle/jruby-gradle-plugin), [jruby-gradle-jar-plugin](https://github.com/jruby-gradle/jruby-gradle-jar-plugin) and the [jruby-gradle-war-plugin](https://github.com/jruby-gradle/jruby-gradle-war-plugin)
